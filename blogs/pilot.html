<p>What is Sujnana?
<strong>Sujnana</strong> -pronounced <strong>su-jnƒÅ-na</strong> is a Kannada word <strong>‡≤∏‡≥Å‡≤ú‡≥ç‡≤û‡≤æ‡≤®</strong> meaning <em>good knowledge</em>.
I like writing, writing about the stuff I learn, writing about the stuff/projects I do, writing about the experiences I had, writing about the journeys I go through and writing about my thoughts/idea/feelings. So here I write blog posts which, hopefully deliver good knowledge to the readers as intended.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>Why is Sujnana?
I felt like all the above mentioned writings-except the last one, that&rsquo;s for  my personal diary-can be made public, now, I know probably no one is even reading this one but hey, what if they do in the future? Even if they don&rsquo;t this will be like a documentation of my wisdom for me to look back and recollect.
Also, I was inspired by <a href="https://justfuckingusehtml.com/" target="_blank">this</a> and wanted to build a sleek, minimal website using just vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. So, Sujnana was the perfect reason to do this.</p>

<h2 id="how">How?</h2>

<p>How is Sujnana?
This site is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub pages</a>, if you don&rsquo;t know what GitHub pages is, <a href="#tldr">click here for the TL;Dr</a>
As mentioned above, all web pages are static vanilla JS, CSS &amp; HTML pages, I intend to make this cooler and more dynamic in the future but I have to earn some ‚Çπs before I can expect that.
If you want to see the source code you can find it <a href="https://github.com/truerexdy/sujnana" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>You can either use your browser&rsquo;s back button or click on the Sujnana logo on the top of these blog pages to go back to the main index page.</li>
<li>The index page is sorted reverse chronologically, so newest blogs are at the top.</li>
<li>Just as a bonus, there&rsquo;s a progress bar in the top, you know just to motivate you to read till the end.</li>
<li>I know that you might be smarter than me and want to correct some things I&rsquo;ve said in these blogs, you can report them to this E-Mail. <code>hirexdy@proton.me</code></li>
<li>If you just want to have a casual chat with me, collaborate with me, ask you questions or whatever, you can ping me on <a href="https://rexdy.bsky.social" target="_blank">Blueskyü¶ã</a> or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rexdy.ka/" target="_blank">Instagram</a></li>
</ul>

<p>That&rsquo;s it, bye :)</p>

<p id="tldr"><strong>TL;DR</strong> is that it&rsquo;s a service/feature offered by GitHub, using which you can publicly host your <u>static website</u>. Without any hassle of domain names, hosting, server, cloud etc. just put the .js, .css and .html files of your static webpage in a github repo and that&rsquo;s it. Only catch is that the URL is a github.io domain not a custom domain which many people desire but if you buy a custom domain name, you can use it for you GitHub Page.</p>
