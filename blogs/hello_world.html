        <p>Hello, hope you are doing great.</p>

<p>This is my personal blog site, I made this website after getting inspired by <a href="https://justfuckingusehtml.com/" target="_blank">this</a> and also I have been thinking of writing blogs for a long time now.</p>

<p>Anyway this is my first ever blog on this site so I don&rsquo;t have much to say, it&rsquo;s 01:22 in the morning and I just finished implementing v1 of this site. I built this website 2 days before my Microcontrollers exam and I have not even started preparing for it.</p>

<p>Anyway, more blogs coming your way soon so stay tuned to this site and share this site with your friends who might get inspired by this.</p>

<p>Thank you, bye ;)</p>
